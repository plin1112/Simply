# Simply - simulating polymerizations

--Work in progress--

Simply is a Monte Carlo simulator for polymerization reactions. It is written in Python and C and works on UNIX and Windows systems. Over the next few weeks, I'll be setting up this project on Github (in the meantime learning how to use Github in the first place).
